# Tooling Reference

Loa exposes a fixed Tool Manager surface from `internal/tools/manager.go`. Model primitives request tools through structured payloads; the Tool Manager performs the operation and returns a `ToolResult`.

Tool permissions and task read-only state determine whether a requested tool is available/approved. Tool categories below describe implementation behavior, not a blanket safety guarantee.

## 1. File Read / Search Tools

### `read_file`

Reads a complete non-binary project-relative file.

```json
{"path":"main.go"}
```

### `read_range`

Reads a line range from a project-relative file.

```json
{"path":"main.go","start":10,"end":40}
```

### `search_path`

Searches project paths by name fragment.

```json
{"query":"*.go","limit":50}
```

### `search_text`

Literal or regex text search.

```json
{"pattern":"TODO:","regex":false,"limit":50}
```

### `find_symbol`

Queries the code index for a symbol.

```json
{"query":"Manager","limit":10}
```

### `list_symbols`

Lists indexed symbols for one project-relative file.

```json
{"path":"internal/tools/manager.go"}
```

### `read_ast_node`

Runs an `ast-grep` rule over a project file and returns matching source.

```json
{"path":"main.go","rule":"{pattern: 'func $NAME() { $$$BODY }'}"}
```

The current AST-tool implementation constructs its ast-grep rule with language `go`; it should not be documented as a language-agnostic structural parser in its current form.

## 2. File Mutation Tools

These are classified as mutating.

### `write_file`

```json
{"path":"main.go","content":"package main\n"}
```

### `patch_file`

```json
{"path":"main.go","old":"old text","new":"new text","replace_all":false}
```

### `patch_ast_node`

```json
{"path":"main.go","rule":"{pattern: 'func $NAME() { $$$BODY }'}","rewrite":"func $NAME() error { return nil }"}
```

Like `read_ast_node`, the current implementation is Go-oriented.

### `create_directory`

```json
{"path":"internal/newpkg"}
```

### `delete_file`

```json
{"path":"temp.txt"}
```

### `delete_directory`

```json
{"path":"build"}
```

Delete tools are additionally classified as destructive. The directory-delete implementation refuses to delete the project root itself.

## 3. Process Execution

### `execute_process`

Executes a binary directly with arguments.

```json
{"binary":"go","args":["test","./..."],"timeout_seconds":0}
```

### `execute_shell`

Executes through `/bin/sh -c`.

```json
{"command":"go test ./... | tee test.log","timeout_seconds":0}
```

Both are classified as mutating for permissions. They start in the project root, but unlike Loa's file tools they are not restricted by project-root path validation. Their filesystem/OS access is determined by the environment in which Loa is running (host or sandbox).

A non-positive per-call timeout uses the configured command timeout.

## 4. Git Tools

### `git_status`

Runs:

```text
git status --short --branch
```

### `git_diff`

```json
{"staged":false}
```

With `staged: true`, Loa runs `git diff --cached`.

These wrappers execute Git as a child process in the project root.

## 5. Stored Tool Output

### `read_tool_output`

Reads a byte range from the Tool Manager's stored output for a prior call.

```json
{"tool_call_id":123,"offset":0,"limit":16384}
```

Important: ordinary tool output is truncated to `max_stored_tool_output_bytes` **before** it is stored in the manager's output map. `read_tool_output` can page through the stored value; it cannot recover bytes already discarded by that truncation.

## 6. Large File Analysis

### `analyze_large_file`

```json
{"path":"large.log","instructions":"Identify the first failure and its likely cause"}
```

This is not a simple deterministic file reader. The current implementation reads the file in 500-line chunks and invokes the configured executing model iteratively, passing the previous summary and the next chunk to produce a running analysis. It is exempt from the Tool Manager's normal stored-output truncation branch.

This tool is an explicit model-driven summarization/analysis mechanism for a requested large-file operation. It is separate from Loa's core context-window strategy.

## 7. Artifacts

Artifacts live under the active task/session artifact area.

- `artifact_list`
- `artifact_read`
- `artifact_write`
- `artifact_append`
- `artifact_patch`
- `artifact_search`

Write/append/patch artifact tools are omitted from the read-only tool schema.

## 8. Task-Step Introspection

### `search_task_steps`

Searches step information for the active task.

### `read_task_step`

```json
{"step_id":123}
```

Reads stored information for one task step.

## 9. Project-Root Validation

Filesystem tools require project-relative paths. Existing paths are resolved through symlinks and checked against the resolved project root. Creation resolves/checks the real parent before constructing the target path.

Attempts to use an absolute path or escape the project root through traversal/symlinks are rejected by these file-tool helpers.

This path boundary does not apply to arbitrary commands launched by `execute_process`/`execute_shell`.

## 10. Output Truncation

For ordinary tools, the Tool Manager uses `max_stored_tool_output_bytes` (default 4 MiB). If output exceeds the configured limit:

1. the output string is cut to the limit,
2. `ToolResult.Truncated` is set,
3. the truncated value is stored as the tool output.

Documentation should not currently claim a second automatic prompt-output spill-to-artifact stage based on `max_prompt_tool_output_bytes`; that configuration field exists, but this audit found no active runtime consumer in the current engine/Tool Manager path.
